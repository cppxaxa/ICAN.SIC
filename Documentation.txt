GUIDELINES AND ASSUMPTIONS

1. In BrokerHub.cs, we find the PrimaryNamespace by sorting according to "ICAN.SIC" and "ICAN.SIC.Plugin"
2. We instantiate the plugin whose namespace word after last dot (.) is same as the class name
3. We plan to design the components with a Utility, Helper and the Plugin itself for adaptability to testing frameworks
4. Each component can have a "Host" project to instantiate and test it for developer
5. The "Host" can directly reference the component, for rest it's strict to reference using DLL
