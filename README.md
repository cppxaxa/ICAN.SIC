# ICAN.SIC

* SIC -> Second In Command
* The project is based on Publisher-Subscriber architecture written in C#.
* The project identifies it's dll modules and loads them.
* The plugins can interact with each other without knowing each other's existence, hence they are loosely coupled.
* Each plugin can be developed separately.

Some of the first plugins are, SIML based chatbot and a web based chatInterface.
